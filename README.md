# Methodical Cloud

This is the source code for the [Methodical Cloud](https://methodicalcloud.netlify.app/) website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Overview

Methodical Cloud focuses on automation clarity, visual system design, and building workflows that don't suck.  
This site hosts our blog, podcast, and informational content to help IT and engineering professionals navigate complex environments intentionally.

## Structure

- `content/`: Markdown files for Home, About, Blog, Podcast, Contact, and blog posts.
- `layouts/`: Hugo templates (home page, single pages, list pages, partials).
- `static/`: Assets including CSS, JavaScript, and images from the HTML5UP Massively theme.
- `netlify.toml`: Netlify deployment configuration.

## Local Development

   ```bash
   brew install hugo
   ```

2. Start a local server:
   ```bash

   ```

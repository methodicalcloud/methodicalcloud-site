# Methodical Cloud

Welcome to the repository for [methodicalcloud.com](https://methodicalcloud.com) — a modern, content-driven site designed and managed using [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev). The goal is to deliver automation insights, clear system design, and sustainable technical storytelling through a simple and elegant web experience.

## 🧠 What is Methodical Cloud?

Methodical Cloud is a platform focused on clarity in automation, scalable architecture, and practical knowledge sharing.  
We publish blogs, diagrams, and podcasts that aim to simplify complex technology topics — all with a touch of eccentricity and design.

## ✨ Key Features

- Built and deployed with **Vercel v0** (no more Hugo, no build pipeline)
- Clean UI with support for dark mode and responsive design
- Markdown-like editing within v0 UI for content updates
- Integrated GitHub workflows
- Focused on fast publishing of blog posts, diagrams, and podcast episodes

## 🛠️ Repository Purpose

This repo (`methodicalcloud-site`) now serves as the GitHub backend for content and structure managed by v0.

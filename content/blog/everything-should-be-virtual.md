excerpt: "How the original blog evolved into Methodical Cloud ‚Äî and why we're now building products that actually solve problems."
---

Over a decade ago, **Everything Should Be Virtual** was launched to explore infrastructure, virtualization, and the emerging cloud landscape. It became a home for ideas around automation, systems design, and technology evolution.

Today, that journey continues, but with a new, sharper focus.

**Methodical Cloud** builds on that foundation, but we've evolved from content-first to product-first. We're now building intelligent software products that solve real problems:

- **FinInsights** ‚Äî AI-powered personal finance intelligence platform
- **Vaultmind** ‚Äî Secure data intelligence (coming soon)
- **FlowCrimes** ‚Äî Workflow automation tools (coming soon)

Along the way, we share what we learn through blog posts that break down automation, infrastructure, and systems design without the buzzwords.

While the name has changed, the core mission remains: bringing clarity to complex systems through thoughtful, intentional design.

If you followed Everything Should Be Virtual, you're already part of the Methodical Cloud story, and there's so much more to come.

‚öôÔ∏è Still believe everything should be virtual? Us too, but only if it doesn't suck. Stay weird, stay methodical.

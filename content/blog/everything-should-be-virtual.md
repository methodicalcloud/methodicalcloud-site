Over a decade ago, **Everything Should Be Virtual** was launched to explore infrastructure, virtualization, and the emerging cloud landscape. It became a home for ideas around automation, systems design, and technology evolution.

Today, that journey continues ‚Äî but with a new, sharper focus.

**Methodical Cloud** builds on that foundation, evolving into a content-driven platform dedicated to:

- Clear automation strategies
- Scalable system design
- Visual workflows and educational resources

While the name has changed, the core mission remains: bringing clarity to complex systems through thoughtful, intentional design.

If you followed Everything Should Be Virtual, you're already part of the Methodical Cloud story ‚Äî and there's so much more to come.

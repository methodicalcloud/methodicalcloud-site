Ever feel like your brain is tabbed out like a Chrome window with 84 open tabs?

Same.

For folks with ADD (like me), context switching isn't just an inconvenience—it's the natural state of things. I bounce between problems, people, systems, and ideas constantly. And somehow, I mostly remember everything. I don't take notes for myself—I take them for *other people*.

So no, I don't have some perfect “system.” But I do have a few things that help me manage the chaos without losing momentum—or losing my mind.

## Why It Matters

We've glamorized multitasking and “juggling priorities”, but the cost is real:

- Fractured attention
- Task ramp-up fatigue
- Increased friction in flow
- That constant hum of “Did I forget something?”

If your day looks like:
*Meeting → Slack → code review → strategy doc → fire drill → design session*,
…you're not working—you're pivoting. All. Day. Long.

And if you're wired like I am, that can be fuel *or* fire.

## What Helps

### 1. Trust Your Brain—But Reset It

I don't rely on notes, but I do rely on *rhythm*.

- Morning focus ritual (sometimes just sitting in silence with coffee)
- End-of-day recalibration (not a checklist—just asking myself, “Did I finish what mattered today?”)
- White space between tasks. Even 3–5 minutes helps reset my brain for the next jump.

### 2. Define What's “Now”

With so much flying at me, I have to define what's *now*—the one thing I'll snap back to when things get chaotic.

That might be:
> “This hour is for solving X. Interruptions go on the shelf.”

This isn't rigid planning—it's intentional anchoring.

### 3. Externalize for Others, Not Me

I use Obsidian. Not because I need to remember, but because others do. I track discussions, decisions, and designs so the people around me can follow along without needing to sync brains in real-time.

That frees me up to flow without dragging everyone with me.

## Wrapping It Up

I don't beat context switching. I *work with it*.

- **I build rhythms**
- **I define anchors**
- **I only externalize when it helps others**

> The goal isn't perfect focus. The goal is sustainable flow.

At Methodical Cloud, we embrace weird workflows. Whatever helps you move through complexity without collapsing under it—that's the real system.

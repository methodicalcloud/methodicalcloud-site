Over a decade ago, **Everything Should Be Virtual** was launched to explore infrastructure, virtualization, and the emerging cloud landscape. It became a home for ideas around automation, systems design, and technology evolution.

Today, that journey continues â€” but with a new, sharper focus.

**Methodical Cloud** builds on that foundation, evolving into a content-driven platform dedicated to:

- Clear automation strategies.  
- Scalable system design.  
- Visual workflows and educational resources.

While the name has changed, the core mission remains: bringing clarity to complex systems through thoughtful, intentional design.

If you followed Everything Should Be Virtual, youâ€™re already part of the Methodical Cloud story â€” and thereâ€™s so much more to come.

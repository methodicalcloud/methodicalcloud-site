Welcome to *Diagram the Damn Thing* — the Methodical Cloud podcast where we unpack the art and practice of designing better systems.

Each episode is short, sharp, and rooted in real-world experience.  
We explore how visual thinking, thoughtful automation, and intentional architecture can turn chaos into clarity.

This podcast is for anyone who builds, breaks, or leads technical systems — from engineers to architects to curious explorers of complex problems.

New episodes coming soon.

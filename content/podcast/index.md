Welcome to *Diagram the Damn Thing* — the Methodical Cloud podcast where we dig into the messy, the misunderstood, and the overcomplicated world of systems design.

Each short episode is a no-fluff breakdown of how we make automation smarter, diagrams clearer, and tech storytelling suck a lot less.

If you build, fix, or lead technical systems — and want fewer meetings and more clarity — this one’s for you.

Episodes dropping soon.

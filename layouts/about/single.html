      <p>Methodical Cloud was created to bring clarity to complex systems and workflows.<br />
        Born from the ethos of <em>Everything Should Be Virtual</em>, this platform expands the mission into something
        broader: helping people visualize, design, and automate systems that actually work.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity over complexity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Diagrams before delivery</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Automation that serves, not obscures</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Through blogs, podcasts, and shared visual resources, Methodical Cloud is here to help engineers, architects,
        and leaders navigate their systems with purpose.</p>

      <p>This isn’t just content. It’s a movement toward better design and intentional technology.</p>
